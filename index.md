# About - TEST SITE

Agriculture and food systems in Canada not only feed the world but can help us to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of a changing climate. A more resilient and sustainable food system will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, sequester carbon, enhance biodiversity, ensure equity in food access, and support circularity – driving progress for people, our environment and our economy.

Genomics technologies hold incredible potential to achieve this goal. To realize this potential, we not only need innovative genomics research, but we need to collaborate and share data and knowledge across sectors and silos.

Two new collaboration Hubs are now supporting this work across Canada as part of the [Climate-Smart Agriculture and Food Systems (CSAFS) Initiative](https://genomecanada.ca/genome-canada-investments-target-csafs-solutions/#data), funded by Genome Canada. Working with nine [Interdisciplinary Challenge Teams](https://genomecanada.ca/canada-invests-in-world-leading-climate-smart-agriculture-and-food-systems-through-genomics/) (ICT) whose teams will seek solutions aimed at minimizing the impact of agricultural practices on the climate, these twin hubs will support knowledge mobilization, data access, and sharing of information across teams and between ecosystem partners:

- **Agricultural  Genomics Action Centre (AG-ACt)** will bring together participants across the genomics ecosystem, support teams in their mobilization and commercialization of project knowledge, train researchers and students, and synthesize learnings from across projects to inform policy and practice.

- **Climate Smart – Data Collaboration Centre (CS-DCC)** will support research data sharing, management and governance across projects by creating a data ecosystem featuring common frameworks for data exchange and sharing, community-developed data standards, open-source and reusable data processing toolkits, consensus-driven data governance, and training to develop community data competency.
